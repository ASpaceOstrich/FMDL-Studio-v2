# FMDL Studio v2
Fox Engine model importer (and planned exporter) for Unity.

## Usage
Open the project in Unity, go to the *FMDL Studio* menu option and select *Import Fmdl*. Select the .fmdl of your choice and it'll be imported. If you want textures to be applied to the model, they must be placed inside a folder with the same name as the model, inside of the Fmdl Studio folder (the folder containing the textures should be in the folder with the Fmdl Studio solution file).
